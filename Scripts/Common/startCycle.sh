# NOTE: Shift is a builtin command in bash which after getting executed, shifts/move 
#   the command line arguments to one position left (here one position means one 
#   whole argument and move to left means to delete). The first argument is lost after 
#   using shift command. This command takes only one integer as an argument. This 
#   command is useful when you want to get rid of the command line arguments which 
#   are not needed after parsing them. Syntax is "shift n". Here, n is the number 
#   of positions by which you want to shift command-line arguments to the left if 
#   you do not specify, the default value of n is assumed to be 1 i.e shift works 
#   the same as shift 1.
# NOTE: The break statement terminates the current loop and passes program control 
#   to the command that follows the terminated loop.
